// This file serves as the entry point for UI components.
// It's crucial to avoid wildcard exports if any of these components
// are used in client components, as it can lead to larger bundle sizes.
// Instead, use named exports.

// We're not exporting anything here since we don't know which UI components exist
// Client components should import directly from their source files
